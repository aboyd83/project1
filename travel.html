I have had the opportunity to visit 7 counties so far. I have also been blessed to be able to take my son on a few of these vactions as well. Since he has been born he has been to 4 countries so far and if not been for COVID we would have been going to two more last year. I have made a commitment to my self that at least once a year we will travel to a new forein cournty. So with that being said here are my next three places I would like to visit.</p>

  <p> And Last but not least Disney Cruise!! OMG this is every kids dream other than going to Disney its self. This is like kid heaven 3 to 4 levels of non-stop fun. Even if your the parent this ship has something for everyone, if it doesn't turn you into a kid again it will definitely make you remember back to when you were. I plan to take my son on this fun ride hopefully for his 8th bithday. I can not wait. I think I am more excited for this than he will be.</p>
